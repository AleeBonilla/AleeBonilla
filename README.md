👋 Hi, I’m @BonillaAlePY
👀 I’m interested in software development, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence.
🌱 I’m currently learning about object-oriented programming in Java, C++ structures, cybersecurity fundamentals, and exploring AI concepts.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any type of open-source project, as I enjoy adapting to new challenges and learning from different fields.
📫 How to reach me: [alebonilla@estudiantec.cr] or [aleebonilla.dev@gmail.com]
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I entered the field of computer science without knowing anything about it and was unsure if I would enjoy it, but it turned out to be the best decision I've ever made!
